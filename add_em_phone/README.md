This example will add an extension mobility enabled phone to the unified 
communications manager with only the bare minimum (required) settings.  

It will ask for all information needed, which is quite a bit. In real life 
situations most of the info can probably be derived from a couple of datapoints 
combined with a proper standard, e.g. if you have the sitename, the line css, 
phone css and devices pool could have a standard naming of "\<site\> Emergency", 
"\<site\> Restricted" and "\<site\> em phones".  
Based on the site, you might also be able to get the 'next available number'
either from UCM or from a telephony number management system
